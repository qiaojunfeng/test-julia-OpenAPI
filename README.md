# Minimal working example of using `OpenAPI.jl` to upload file

The `openapi-generator 7.10.0` generated julia server/client code has wrong
function type signature for OpenAPI file upload.
This repo shows the error and a fix to it.

The `server/client` folders contain the old code generated by `7.10.0`, while the `server_new/client_new` folders contain updated version generated by my branch at <https://github.com/qiaojunfeng/openapi-generator/tree/fix/julia_file>.
See `generate.sh`.

To test the code, start a server by
```shell
julia --project ServerImpl.jl
```

Then run the client code by
```shell
julia --project test.jl
```

To test the new version, open `test.jl` and change line 3-5 to
```
# include("client/src/APIClient.jl")
# the new one, works fine
include("client_new/src/APIClient.jl")
```
and run again the client code by
```shell
julia --project test.jl
```
